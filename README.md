# CryptoGraffiti v2.0 (discontinued)
A browser-based client for the CryptoGraffiti service which allows the encoding
and decoding of multimedia messages respectively to and from the Bitcoin's block
chain.

This service operates solely on the block chain of the Original Bitcoin which is
also known as Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). For that reason, all references to
Bitcoin are equivalent to [Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io "Homepage of BSV").
